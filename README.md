E-Learning Backend
This is the backend for the E-Learning platform, built using Spring Boot to handle RESTful APIs and business logic. It provides services to manage courses, users, and competitions efficiently.

📚 Features
RESTful API: Clean and structured API endpoints for all backend operations.
Entity Management: Handles user, course, and competition data.
SOLID Architecture: Adheres to clean code principles with layers for controllers, services, and repositories.
Database Integration: Uses MySQL as the primary database with JPA for ORM.
Scalability: Designed to support new features without breaking existing functionality.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Framework for building the application.
Spring Data JPA: For database operations.
MySQL: Relational database.
MapStruct: For DTO mapping.
Swagger: API documentation and testing
📂 Architecture Overview
The backend is structured following a layered architecture:

Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and maps them to service methods.
Service Layer: Contains the business logic and coordinates data flow between the controllers and repositories.
Repository Layer: Interfaces directly with the database using Spring Data JPA.
Entity Layer: Defines the database models and their relationships.
DTO Layer: Facilitates data exchange between APIs and services.
